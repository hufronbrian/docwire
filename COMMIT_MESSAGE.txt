Add recursive folder tracking and WSL polling mode

- Add recursive=True to watchdog observer for subfolder tracking
- Add path_to_storage_name() and storage_name_to_path() helpers
  - ./sub/folder/doc.txt -> sub__folder__doc (double underscore encoding)
- Update all scripts to use storage names: cli.py, watch.py, sync.py, fix.py, archive.py, atomic.py
- Add is_wsl() and needs_polling() detection for WSL + Windows filesystem
- Use PollingObserver when running on WSL with /mnt/* paths (inotify doesn't work there)
- Add -y flag to install.sh for non-interactive installs
- get_txt_files() now recursive by default

Tested on WSL2 with both Windows (/mnt/c/) and Linux (~/) filesystems.

Fix installer not cleaning old template files

- install.ps1: Delete template/ folder before copying to remove legacy .py files at root
- install.sh: Same fix for Linux/Mac/WSL installer
- Fixes issue where old scripts persisted at .dw/ root instead of only in .dw/cor/

---

Fix dw all watch/stop not detecting watchers (DWML parsing)

- Add parse_dwml_registry() and format_dwml_registry() to dwroot.py (win + unx)
- cmd_all_watch and cmd_all_stop now correctly parse DWML format registry
- Registry format: =x= watchers;|path|pid|started|; =z=

---

Auto-run dw all update after install

- install.ps1: Run dw all update after copying files
- install.sh: Same for Linux/Mac/WSL
- All registered projects get updated cor/ scripts automatically

---

Add dw all watch -bg to scan background processes

- Scans for python processes matching watch/docwire/.dw
- Windows: Uses PowerShell Get-CimInstance
- Linux: Uses ps aux
- May include false positives, for debugging orphan watchers

---

Add dw all start for interactive watcher startup

- Lists registered projects with .dw/ folder
- Shows which are already running
- Option 0 to start all, or pick individual projects
- Skips already running watchers

---

Installer stops watchers before update

- install.ps1/sh: Parse dw-registry.txt, kill registered PIDs
- Notifies user to run dw all start after install
- uninstall.ps1/sh: Also stops watchers before removing files

---

Add docs/installer.txt

- Documents install/uninstall behavior
- Reusable patterns for script-based installers
- Code snippets for Windows and Linux
- Common gotchas and DWML registry format

---

Fix dw all start not actually starting watchers

- Changed subprocess call to run dwroot.py directly with 'start' arg
- Previous approach imported cli module but daemon didn't spawn properly
- Now calls same path as manual 'dw start' command
- Fixed for both win/dwroot.py and unx/dw

---

Fix PowerShell reserved variable $pid

- Changed $pid to $procId in install.ps1 and uninstall.ps1
- $pid is reserved in PowerShell (returns current process ID)
