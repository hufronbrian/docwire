Add recursive folder tracking and WSL polling mode

- Add recursive=True to watchdog observer for subfolder tracking
- Add path_to_storage_name() and storage_name_to_path() helpers
  - ./sub/folder/doc.txt -> sub__folder__doc (double underscore encoding)
- Update all scripts to use storage names: cli.py, watch.py, sync.py, fix.py, archive.py, atomic.py
- Add is_wsl() and needs_polling() detection for WSL + Windows filesystem
- Use PollingObserver when running on WSL with /mnt/* paths (inotify doesn't work there)
- Add -y flag to install.sh for non-interactive installs
- get_txt_files() now recursive by default

Tested on WSL2 with both Windows (/mnt/c/) and Linux (~/) filesystems.

Fix installer not cleaning old template files

- install.ps1: Delete template/ folder before copying to remove legacy .py files at root
- install.sh: Same fix for Linux/Mac/WSL installer
- Fixes issue where old scripts persisted at .dw/ root instead of only in .dw/cor/
